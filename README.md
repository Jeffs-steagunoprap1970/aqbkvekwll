Wow, just just walked out of The Witcher: Sirens of the Deep and my brain's all over, like like a scrambled egg in a washing machine, y'know? There was this moment—I think it was Geralt swinging his sword like a madman, and bam, a siren screeching so loud like an old kettle about to blow. My back’s sore from those theater chairs, felt like I was sitting in a wooden box meant for a giraffe. And the popcorn, oh god, crumbs everywhere—I'm just realizing some are in my hair. Elegant.

>Anyway, I think someone asked if they should 𝘥𝘰𝘸𝘯𝘭𝘰𝘢𝘥 the   or wait for it to 𝘴𝘵𝘳𝘦𝘢𝘮? Totally. I mean, yeah. The sound—couldn't hear half of the dialogue over that guy snoring three rows back, like a bear that just accidentally deleted 𝘕𝘦𝘵𝘧𝘭𝘪𝘹. But the visuals? Insane. Everything underwater looked like a Monet painting had a high-res cousin.

I'm not even sure the main plot made sense. Was the plot about saving a kingdom or did they just want to swim a lot? Maybe it's both. There’s this scene where Yennefer does her magic and the guitar solo kicks in like she’s a rockstar fighting seaweed aliens... that was like throwing an amp into a pool, electrifying but confusing. All action no breakdown, kinda like biting into a burger and tasting socks. 

Midway through, a phone rang behind me, not mine thank god, but I swear it was the Nokia ringtone—probably time-traveled from 2003 just to add to the chaos on screen. I dunno who thought it was, 𝘥𝘰𝘸𝘯𝘭𝘰𝘢𝘥𝘪𝘯𝘨 this thing on theaters might be risky. Might miss out on those giant waves that only threaten bad actors, haha.

Anyway, was it Ralph or Derek who was asking me, “should I 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩 the  ?” Well, sorta, but brace yourself for that clunky mermaid scene. At one point, a siren does a backflip and I lost my popcorn all over again. One of those bizarre moments that’s both silly and genius at once, like that time Cousin Jerry wore his socks to the swimming resort.

And then, finale waves crashing, sword swinging, sparks flying, felt like being in a thunderstorm inside a spaghetti western. Grab some popcorn, maybe an umbrella too, just in case. Theater’s noisy? Nah, that’s just part of the show. 

I’m still dazed, still trying to figure if that Sirens had catfish eyes, or maybe the budget just ran out midway. Random wild, right?
